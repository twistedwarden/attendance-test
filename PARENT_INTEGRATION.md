### Dependencies Added
The following dependencies were added to support the parent portal:

- `@radix-ui/*`: UI component primitives
- `class-variance-authority`: Component variant management
- `clsx` & `tailwind-merge`: CSS class utilities
- `date-fns`: Date manipulation
- `react-day-picker`: Date picker component
- `react-hook-form`: Form handling
- `react-router-dom`: Client-side routing
- `lucide-react`: Icon library

### TypeScript Integration
- All components converted to TypeScript
- Proper type definitions for all interfaces
- Type-safe data handling

## Authentication

### Parent User
- Email: `sarah.johnson@email.com`
- Password: `parent123`
- Role: `parent`

### User Type Updates
The `User` interface was updated to include the `parent` role:
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'teacher' | 'parent';
  email: string;
  section?: string;
  gradeLevel?: string;
}
```

## Usage

1. **Login**: Use the parent credentials to log in
2. **Student Selection**: Choose a student from the sidebar dropdown
3. **Navigation**: Use the sidebar to navigate between:
   - Dashboard (overview)
   - Profile (manage information)
   - Attendance (detailed records)
4. **Date Filtering**: Use the date picker to filter attendance records
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom CSS for react-day-picker component
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent with the existing design system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Data Integration**: Replace mock data with API calls
2. **Notifications**: Add real-time attendance notifications
3. **Reports**: Generate attendance reports
4. **Communication**: Add messaging system with teachers
5. **Calendar Integration**: Sync with external calendars

## Notes

- The parent portal is fully functional with mock data
- All components are TypeScript-compliant
- Responsive design works across different screen sizes
- Integration maintains consistency with existing admin and teacher modules
